# Bangalore_Home_Price_Pred
A website that helps user estimate cost of their house based on the location, size of house in(sq.ft), number of rooms and number of bathrooms all in Bangalore.
Here I have created 3 folders:
  1. Client - Contains the front end code of website.
  2. Server - Consists of the backend of the website. A Flask based backend file.
  3. Model - Consists of the trained Machine Learning model used for prediciting the house prices.
The main purpose of this project is to help users learn the estimate price of their dream house in their dream place. The accuracy of prediction is above 95% trained and tested so it's a highly reliable model.
